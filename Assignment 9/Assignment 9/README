README Assignment 9

Type safety warning: IRL, this would probably be a place for @SuppressWarnings.
We are making an array of nodes which will all have the same type <K, V> so this
is a case of the Java compiler being paranoid about type safety.

I approached this assignment wanting to create an array of singly linked lists
(nodes). I first began by writing my testing functions (Jaybee/JUnit4), then my
HashMap implementation, then came back and benchmarked my HashMap vs the given
SimpleMap, given BinarySearchTreeMap, and (dubious) implementations of 
AVLTreeMap and TreapMap I wrote for Assignment 8. 
For HashMap, I first wrote the hash and hashindex functions, then node class,
then everything else (insert/put/get/...), and iterator last.  
At first, I struggled with handling collisions (adding to the .next)
and got many outofbounds exceptions.

ListTestBase: for(String s: list) loops have been omitted due to anomalies.
	Other tests using toString and length work properly, but there is a 
	problem counting using this loop. See email thread from 
	kverdey1@jhu.edu.

List Reflection
Q1: You cannot make a list of arrays with the current data abstraction. 
	Even if Java itself let you, there would be significant difficulty
	in accessing the array inside the list and would require further 
	methods to fix that. The Oracle implementation of the List 
	uses ints for positions to make it more like an array, while our
	implementation uses a Position abstract for each node. This can 
	be both a blessing and a curse, as it enables static calling of a
	position but can't be constantly referenced like our Position can
	(e.g the indices may stay the same, but the data may change
	in the specific indice based on inserts/removes).
	We could omit methods like insertFront, insertBack, empty(), 
	removefront, removeback, instead replacing them with specific
	positions in insertbefore/after, size==0 and remove(p). However
	it helps that we have these methods built into the class because 
	it makes certain actions simpler. Finally I think nomenclature for
	certain methods (namely first() and last()) should be named isFirst
	and isLast since we're checking that the passed position is first,
	not calling the first position.

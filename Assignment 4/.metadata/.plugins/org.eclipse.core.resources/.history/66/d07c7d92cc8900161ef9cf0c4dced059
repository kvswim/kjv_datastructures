Assignment 4

Checkstyle errors: 
I chose to catch Exception as a general exception instead of a
NullPointer or EmptyException so it can handle any kind of exception. 
Cyclomatic complexity: I tried making the if switch into its own method but
could only solve a complexity of 12.
Inner assignments: I kept the integer assignments in the line, taking them out
causes some weird deque instability.
oStack matches the proper pattern, don't know why I'm getting that...
Assert.* was the default import for an Eclipse junit file, not sure what I was
supposed to import specifically.

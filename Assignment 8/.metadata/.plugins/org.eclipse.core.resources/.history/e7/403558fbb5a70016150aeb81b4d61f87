Since the input files vary widely, memory usage can be ignored (only noting the
fact that more input = more memory usage). We can also see that for small n, 
(1-10k) the different data sets don't have much time difference. It is only with
large n (100k, 500k) that we can see a pattern more clearly. The sorted list
takes the least amount of time because the insertions are in order and the tree
will only be root-right-right-right... and will always append at the end of the
tree. This doesn't really make much sense since linear insertion (the worst case
scenario) should take O(n) time while at best O(log(n)). The biased set is next 
because there are some (50%) repeating numbers that only need node updates,
rather than recursively rebuilding the tree. Taking the longest time is the
random data set, due to having to rebuild the tree for every single insertion.

---Problem 1: BinarySearchTreeBench.java (Jaybee)
      insertLinearBSTM	     30000	     43065 ns/op	        13 B/op
insertLookupLinearBSTM	     30000	     57465 ns/op	        13 B/op
insertLookupRandomBSTM	     50000	     26614 ns/op	        55 B/op
      insertRandomBSTM	    100000	     17669 ns/op	        45 B/op
insertRemoveLinearBSTM	     30000	     40956 ns/op	        13 B/op
insertRemoveRandomBSTM	     50000	     30302 ns/op	       132 B/op
We can see from these results a picture that is more in line with what we expect
from linear vs. random insertions into the BST. Inserting (+removing) linearly
takes more time than inserting/removing random numbers because the tree is in a
more conventional configuration in random. Looking up in a linear tree takes
much longer than random.

---Problem 2: AVLTreeMap.java (Words.java)
Memory consumption has been left out as it's not very important to the problem.
Based on average of 4 runs:
Biased (50%):
	1k: 0.2075 sec
	10k: 0.3475 sec
	100k: 1.1175 sec
	500k: 4.28 sec
Sorted (0%):
	1k: 0.21 sec
	10k: 0.425 sec
	100k: 1.2425 sec
	500k: 3.7025 sec
Random (0%):
	1k: 0.1925 sec
	10k: 0.39 sec
	100k: 1.34 sec
	500k: 5.76 sec
As we can see, in the case of an AVL tree, we still bench the data sets from
Sorted>Biased>Random (fastest-slowest). This is not what we have learned in
lecture, a sorted insertion should be taking the longest time. Although
accessing a balanced tree is supposed to be faster than unbalanced, we are only
benchmarking for insertions, hence the balanced tree takes longer to insert into
because of overhead involved in constant rebalancing. 

---Problem 2: AVLTreeMap.java (BalancedBSTBench.java)
      insertLinearAVL	     30000	     49777 ns/op	        13 B/op
insertLookupLinearAVL	     20000	     62892 ns/op	       130 B/op
insertLookupRandomAVL	     50000	     29077 ns/op	        55 B/op
      insertRandomAVL	    100000	     20529 ns/op	        55 B/op
insertRemoveLinearAVL	     30000	     55486 ns/op	        13 B/op
insertRemoveRandomAVL	     50000	     34805 ns/op	       123 B/op
We see here that random insertion is much faster than linear insertion, which is
what we expect. Once again, operations take slightly longer than the unbalanced
tree due to overhead in rebalancing. And again, looking up random items takes
much less time than linear lookups. 

---Problem 3: TreapMap.java (Words.java) averaged over 4 runs
(memory consumption not included)
Biased (50%):
	1k: 0.2 sec
	10k: 0.395 sec
	100k: 1.365 sec
	500k: 5.6725 sec
Sorted (0%):
	1k: 0.2125 sec
	10k: 0.4725 sec
	100k: 1.2425 sec
	500k: 4.09 sec
Random (0%):
	1k: 0.2125 sec
	10k: 0.515 sec
	100k: 1.6275 sec
	500k: 7.195 sec
We see in the TreapMap that random insertions are the slowest, followed by
biased data and then sorted data. This is probably because treaps can insert
sequentially quickly due to the "random" priority structure. This implementation
is apparently much slower than the other BST and AVL trees.

---Problem 3: TreapMap.java (TreapMapBench.java)
      insertLinearTM	     20000	     59952 ns/op	       323 B/op
insertLookupLinearTM	     20000	     90723 ns/op	       192 B/op
insertLookupRandomTM	     10000	    114116 ns/op	       152 B/op
      insertRandomTM	     20000	     77284 ns/op	       213 B/op
insertRemoveLinearTM	     20000	    115796 ns/op	        69 B/op
insertRemoveRandomTM	     10000	    121006 ns/op	       468 B/op
We see here that random insertions now take longer than linear insertions. 
This is because of the treap's balancing being done by random priority order and
no real balancing being done. The computer must traverse the tree in order to
insert/remove/lookup a random item.
